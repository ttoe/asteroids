# WIP

# Asteroids

An Asteroids clone written in `C` using [Raylib](https://www.raylib.com).

Inspired by watching [this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abIlGCx_Yq8) but implemented again as an exercise.

# Dependencies

The game was only tested on `macOS` (12.7) and compiled with `clang` (14.0).

The library `raylib` must be installed.

The run-script uses `pkg-config`. If that is not available, the compiler flags can be added manually.

# Building / Running

Run the bash script `run.sh`. Adjust if needed.

# Assets

TODO credit
